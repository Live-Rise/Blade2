/**
 * The web-search page's staged form over three settings namespaces: `web`,
 * whose provider selection the Search API switch writes, `web-search-deepseek`
 * for Messages search, and `web-deepseek-api` for the Search and Fetch APIs.
 *
 * The switch selects `deepseek-search-api` and `deepseek-fetch-api` together, or
 * Messages search with local HTTP fetch. A selection equal to the deployment's
 * composed value clears the override instead of storing a copy of it.
 *
 * The key is the one control that does not live in a section: its literal
 * never rides a response, so the page learns only whether one is configured
 * and writes it through the credentials domain, addressed by the reference the
 * selected API's section names. It is still staged with the rest of the form,
 * so one save covers everything the page shows.
